  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups peeled, sliced apples (such as Granny Smith)</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 cups packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Set
      aside.
    </li>
    <li>In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>
      In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until
      light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each
      addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with
      the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread half of the batter into the prepared baking dish. Arrange the apple
      mixture evenly over the batter. Top with the remaining batter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes
      out clean.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow the pie cake to cool before serving. Optionally, dust with powdered
      sugar or serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
    </li>
  </ol>
