</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
  <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
  <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
  <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2 cups canned cherries, drained</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake
    pans.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a large bowl, sift together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder,
    baking soda, and salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract to the dry
    ingredients. Mix until well combined.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in boiling water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin,
    but that's okay.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-35
    minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow the cakes to cool completely before assembling the Black Forest Cake.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla
    extract, and continue whipping until stiff peaks form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of whipped cream
    over the cake and top with half of the cherries. Place the second cake layer
    on top and repeat the process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optionally, garnish the top with chocolate shavings. Refrigerate before
    serving.
  </li>
</ol>
