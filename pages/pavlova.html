  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>Assorted fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment
      paper.
    </li>
    <li>In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>
      Gradually add the granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time, while
      continuing to beat until the meringue is glossy.
    </li>
    <li>Gently fold in the vinegar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>
      Spoon the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet, shaping it into a
      circle or oval.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a shallow well in the center of the meringue to hold the toppings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 1 hour or until the pavlova is crisp on the outside. Turn off the
      oven and let it cool completely inside the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and
      continue whipping until stiff peaks form.
    </li>
    <li>
      Carefully transfer the pavlova to a serving plate. Fill the well with
      whipped cream and top with fresh berries.
    </li>
    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy the light and delightful Berry Pavlova</li>
